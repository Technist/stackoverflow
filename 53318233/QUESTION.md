I would like to display a rectangle behind a word I selected like Qt Creator does here:
![QtCreator does this when I select a word.][1]

I am experimenting with the example of QSyntaxHighlighter. I am able to change styles based on keyword patterns. I would like to have graphics or widgets for custom autocompletion lists.
